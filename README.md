1. Project Overview 🚀
This project implements a structured, Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system with automated workflows to streamline user, group, and role management in a project environment.
 * Project Name: Optimizing User, Group, and Role Management with Access Control and Workflows
 * Team ID: NM2025TMID03292 🆔
 * Core Technology: ServiceNow ☁️💻
2. Problem Statement 🤯
The core problem was the lack of clear role definitions, structured access permissions, and automated task workflows in small teams (e.g., Project Manager 'Alice' and Team Member 'Bob').
This resulted in:
 * Overlapping responsibilities ❌
 * Inefficiencies in task execution 🐌
 * Confusion in task assignments and security ❓
3. Solution and Key Features ✅🛡️
The solution introduces RBAC and workflow automation to ensure members operate within clear, assigned responsibilities.
